# Cflat

This package implements the Câ™­ language (pronounced C-flat). It aims to implement the procedural subset of C#.

Currently, it supports:
- integers and booleans.
- variable declarations and assignments in one statement.
- variable assignments.
- branches with `if` and `else`.
- blocks.
- `while`, `do-while` and `for` loops.
- strings can be printed but is not handled nicely.
- optional initial environment (map from variable names to values)

Functionality implemented:
- Lexing
- Parsing
- Rendering of abstract syntax tree
- Evaluation of abstract syntax tree (result as a map of variables)
